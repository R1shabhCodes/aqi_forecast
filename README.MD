## ⚡ Getting Started

1. **Install Python dependencies (for data/scripts):**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas statsmodels plotly
   ```
2. **Generate or update datasets:**
   - Run `script.py` to create `air_quality_dataset.json` (see `data-scripts` branch).
3. **Start the app:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - All features work offline with the sample dataset, or use your own API keys for live data.

## 🔮 Forecasting

- The Forecast page currently uses a simple statistical/random model for AQI prediction.
- For real ML/statistical forecasting, see the `ml-forecast` branch and its instructions/scripts.

---

## 🌐 API Integration

- Uses [OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) for real-time AQI and pollutant data.
- API key is managed securely via `.env` (see `.env.sample`).
